Part 2 - Refining the UX & optional "help" sections
From Rocket55's site: 
UX is important because it tries to fulfill the user's needs. It aims to provide positive experiences that keep users loyal to the product or brand. Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to business success.

In order for your app to have good UX, each part should be either intuitive or clearly & concisely explained.

Part 3 - Landing page + promoting on social media
Why we have this section
Projects without landing pages end up being COMPLETELY invisible to recruiters & employers. If they are not promoted on social media are RARELY seen by recruiters & employers.

Part 3.A: You must create a landing page for your app that clearly explains your product. Google "Product Landing Page" for examples of standard landing pages for products.

Part 3.B: promote your project on social media! LinkedIn and Twitter are great places to be.  Make sure you paste your posts + tweets inside the Discord server! and tag Mintbean!!!
